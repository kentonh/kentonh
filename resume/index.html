          <p>I make things. I make people make things. Mostly digital things. I see big problems and immediately break them down into smaller, manageable parts. I am skilled at arranging these parts in a logical order that creates a clear road map to our team's goal. I want to work with a team I can trust and learn from, and to build a product I can be proud of.</p>
          <p>I've spent my career building more than 50 products, in both a consulting capacity as well as an internal team member of the team. I've managed teams from two to thirty, both technical and non-technical.</p>
