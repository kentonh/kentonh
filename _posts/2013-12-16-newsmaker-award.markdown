In 2013, the Wichita Business Journal compiled a list of 23 groups and people to honor as "Newsmakers." The individuals on the list were chosen because their work made waves, raised eyebrows, and made others take notice. [I was lucky enough to be on that list](https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/news/2013/12/05/wbj-announces-2013-newsmakers.html).

### Startup Weekend comes to Wichita

My main contribution to my community in 2013 was the first Startup Weekend event. I was interviewed with my co-organizer, and the result was published in two articles, ["Hansen and George help Wichita build startup momentum"](https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/blog/2014/01/newsmakers-hansen-george-help.html") and [Startup Weekend organizers Hansen and George on what Wichita needs to do next](https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/blog/techflash/2014/01/startup-weekend-organizers-hansen-and.html).
