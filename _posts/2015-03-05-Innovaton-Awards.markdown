In 2014, I led more than a few efforts at building the tech, software, and startup communities in Wichita, Kansas. For those efforts, I was recognized in the first ever Innovation Awards as one of (only five individual honorees)[https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/blog/techflash/2015/03/five-individuals-will-be-recognized-with-wbj.html].
