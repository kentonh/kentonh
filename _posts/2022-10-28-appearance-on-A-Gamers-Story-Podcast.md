## A Gamer's Story

I joined fellow gamer, teenager, and podcaster Noah Gicas on his show to talk about tabletop games, video games, role playing games, and how I came to work in the games industry.

I had an amazing time talking with Noah. He asked great questions, and really made me think. He also agreed to do the recording at the only time and day I was available - Saturday at 9am - which shows incredible dedication.
