## My friends and I are always curious
We’ve been known to do hours of research because to satisfy a random curiosity. One time my friend [Jarrett](https://jarrettgreen.com) got [noticed](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2011/03/i-always-wondered.html) and then turned down a book deal based on his illustrations paired with hours exploring internet rabbit holes. When he suggested that we start a podcast, I realized it was the one hobby that I hadn’t started during the Pandemic.

## How to start a podcast
Just kidding - there are a thousand places on the internet to tell you that. I’ll just add that the first episode was a lost cause, but we learned a lot. We iterated and got four more in the can before launching our first. We plan to release a new episode every other week.
