## About the Project
In early 2015, I first saw the Filimin Prototype. It was at a mixer co-hosted by devICT, Make ICT, and Startup Wichita. John Harrison made the system as a way to keep his family closer. While they were spread throughout the world, they often didn't have time to speak, and he wanted a way to share love in a non-intrusive way.

As soon as I saw them I knew this was a marketable product, mainly because I wanted to buy them. John and I talked about how we could make it a reality for everyone, and not just me. I helped put together a team to bring the project to market.

We decided that [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnharrison/filimin-a-wi-fi-enabled-touch-light-that-connects) would be the best market to reduce startup costs, and leverage sharing. Soon after launch we received a _Staff Pick_ from Kickstarter, and became the highest grossing Kickstarter Campaign from Kansas, surpassed in 2016.

## My Contribution
I used my skills of project management to organize the various members of the team, create and orchestrate the marketing and PR, and roadmap the product development from a software and hardware perspective.

## Growth

Since the Kickstarter success, the first round of lights have been shipped to all backers and pre-orders. Now, Filimin is carried exclusively by [Uncommon Goods](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/long-distance-touch-lamp).
