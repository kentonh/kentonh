## Um. What now?
A few years ago, my family wanted to get in touch with the traditions of our ancestors. Researching my Danish roots, we came across [Nisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisse_(folklore)) (pronoced like "niss-ay"). The tradition holds that the spirit of the first farmer to clear the land stayed there, protecting the current residents. And around the solstice, the tiny sprite would be mishcevious with the inhabitants of the homestead.

### The trickster elf appealed to us in sevearal ways.

## 2019

This year, we planned a stealth mission. We secured second hand clothes to create costumes for three characters. Not so much _out of style_, but with their _own unique_ style.
