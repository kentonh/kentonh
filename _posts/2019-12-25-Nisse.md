## Um. What now?
A few years ago, my family wanted to get in touch with the traditions of our ancestors. Researching my Danish roots, we came across [Nisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisse_(folklore)) (pronoced like "niss-ay"). The tradition holds that around the solstice, the tiny sprite would be mishcevious with the inhabitants of the homestead.

### The trickster elf appealed to us in sevearal ways.

## 2019

This year, we planned a stealth mission. We secured second hand clothes to create costumes for three characters. Not so much _out of style_, but with their _own unique_ style. After an evening photo shoot, we printed the photos and covertly brought them to each celebration. Once there was a window of opportunity, we placed the photo in an obvious yet discrete place. The photos had a link to this page.

### That may be why you're here.
